# Medical Appointments Record Analysis  
In this project, I worked on a dataset called "noshowappointmetns" which has the records of medical appointments for 110k patients. This dataset includes many features of these patients and whether they showed up or didn't for their medical appointments. My goal was to decide which features affected the patients showing up rate going through the complete data analysis process.
