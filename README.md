# Medical Appointments Record Analysis  
In this project, I worked on a dataset called "noshowappointmetns" which has the records of medical appontments for 110k patients. This dataset includes many features of these patients and wether they show up or don't for their medical appointments. My goal is to decide which features affect the patients showing up rate going through the complete data analysis process.
